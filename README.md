# Tools analyzing scRNA-seq counts data
This repository contains functions that I have found helpful to analysis scRNA-seq data generated with Seurat. In the top of the lookup_gene.py module, I have included some code for porting the data used here from Seurat to csv files. I hope that the functions and here will be useful and helpful for other people analyzing scRNA-seq data. Please let me know if you think there is any more functionality that would be useful to have in this sort of package.
