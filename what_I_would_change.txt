I intend to clean up the code in some of the differential_expression functions, specifically "lookup_gene()" - there are some parameters 
I included in earlier iterations of the function that are no longer necessary and I plan on removing those parameters and the code that used them.
Also, I plan on implementing looping in the "plot_differential_expression()" function in the "plotting_functions" module.
